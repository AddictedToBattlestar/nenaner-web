    <h4>Support for the College Relations application</h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            Gather registration information from college events using this application and send what has been
            recorded
            to
            yourself afterwards.
            Network connectivity is not necessary to enter and manage registrant information.
        </p>

        <h5>Locking feature</h5>
        <p>
            The application does not initially have a PIN setup. You will need to open the Setup screen from the
            menu
            and set
            a PIN of
            your preference. Once done, the unlock feature of this application will require the PIN to be entered
            in
            order to
            continue.
            It is important to set this up first so that accumulated sign in data is not tampered with.
        </p>
        <p>
            Set up the iPad so that the “Guided Access” feature is enabled. See the link below provided from Apple
            that
            describes how
            this can be completed. This will allow you to lock down the iPad when attending events so that no one
            can
            access
            any
            other applications that are installed.
        </p>
        <div>
            <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202612">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202612</a>
        </div>

        <h5>Event tagging</h5>
        <p>
            In the Setup screen, update the Event field prior to attending any event. Every registrant moving
            forward
            will
            then be tagged
            with the name of that Event.
        </p>

        <h5>Extract via email</h5>
        <p>
            The Sign In Listing screen will list all registrants that have accumulated over time. From this screen
            you
            can
            edit, update, email, and clear these registrants from the iPad.
        </p>
        <div>The email feature on the Sign In Listing page will only be show if the below 2 things are performed:</div>
        <ul>
            <li>The Mail application on the device is setup to send email.</li>
            <li>The "Preferred destination email address" has been entered on the Setup page.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</body>
